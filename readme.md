## My process

-Built using semantic html markup.
-No special layout methods required.
-Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I had to learn to use git in order to make the project available for public viewing.
Any techniques applied to recreate this layout were those i was already familliar with.

### Continued development

I would like to improve my current knowledge of css before i feel comfortable enough to move on to javascript.
